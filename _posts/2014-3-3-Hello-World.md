We run a weekly game of pickup basketball in the backyard of one of our members. The Rose Lane Basketball League is non-commercial, strictly for play between friends and neighbors. Admittance to the league is invite-only. If you are invited, we will ask you to send a text a phone number with a keyword, so you can be added to a list that we use for sending notices via SMS whenever we are organizing a game. The SMS list is not used for any other purpose and you can remove your number at any time by request.
